#It features a simple text field where users can input a keyword of their liking and a button for search function

#The images are displayed in a grid layout with corresponding titles

#After searching a keyword, four images are displayed initially, after clicking 'view more' button,
#four more images are added and so on as a form of infinit scrolling
